# Digital-Guitar-Effects

#### We aim to develop signal processing “effects” for guitarists which will allow them to vary the tones of their instrument as per their desire.

#### Codes for Echo effect, Distortion, Wah Wah effect, Phaser Effect and Chorus effect were written on MATLAB and in C(in the docx file) compatible for CCS and DSK C6713
